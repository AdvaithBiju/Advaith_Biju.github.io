      "info": "BMW “GTR GT” (M3 GTR, E46) — A real GT race car built by BMW M Motorsport for the American Le Mans Series (ALMS). The 2005 NFS: Most Wanted legend was based on this 2001 racer—famous for its silver-blue look, brutal sound, and V8 punch. On track it over-delivered fast: 7 wins in 10 races, plus the 2001 GT drivers’ title for Jörg Müller, and BMW also took team + manufacturer championships. Specs (race): ~450 hp 4.0L P60B40 V8 • 1,100 kg • ~260 km/h top speed. Fun fact: BMW recreated the game livery on an original 2001 car and displayed it at BMW Welt Munich (from 27 Nov 2024)."
